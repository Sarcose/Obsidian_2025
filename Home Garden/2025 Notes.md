## Tomatoes
- Seedling attempts failed. Next year try seedlings with real seed starter
- Neighbors' tomatoes successful. Next year need tomato cages
- Without tomato cages, tomatoes will choke each other. Heirloom species will graft themselves into the stalk systems of other varieties, causing those varieties to fruit heirlooms. In 2025 there were very few non-heirlooms fruited
- Without tomato cages, big ripe tomatoes get eaten readily by wild animals/bugs. When big tomatoes are exposed visibly they get snatched up quickly. Possibly our raccoon population?

## Peppers
- Seedlings failed. Peppers were overtaken by squash almost entirely.

## Squash

### Summer
- Just one or maybe two summer squash plants next year. They get huge and take up too much space. Prune regularly.

### Winter
- Tougher to grow, gets overshadowed by other squashes. Devote more to this one.

### Zucchini
- Easily grows and creates a huge territory. Can get massive

## Okra


## Potatoes
- Planted, wait for flowering

## Peas
- Planted, as of 7/23 has not grown well yet. Look this up, maybe re-plant

## Lettuce
- Lettuce can easily grow bitter
- Succession planting - pulling whole plant up, planting new - can keep bitterness to a minimum
- Pull leaves in whole before plant shoots
- Keep well-watered
- Grow in colder season -- too much heat can cause bitterness
- Grow in best soil quality -- poor nutrition can cause bitterness

## Onions
- Large bulbs not attempted. Small split white onions attempted with relative success. Do more of these?
