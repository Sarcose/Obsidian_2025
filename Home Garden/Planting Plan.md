### Chitting Potatoes:
- Rinse storebought potatoes in cold water
- Place potatoes in shallow dish/box in cool dark place for 2 weeks -- this causes "eyes"
- Once they have eyes, apply them 6-8 hours of light, which will cause sprouting
- >45℉ can immediately begin planting potato sprouts
**To Separate and Plant**:
- Cut a ring of potato around a single sprout
- Plant upward , sprouts sticking just above ground.
- Tolerant of transplanting. Can be pre-planted in starter pots prior to transplanting outdoors!

### Growing Bulb Onions from Sprouts:
- When cutting bulbs, cut off bottom (root side) at last 1/4 of onion and save
	- "When I cut down to the core of the onion I usually find two or three center shoots, which I very gently separate by cutting straight down between them with a thin paring knife, being sure to include a piece of the root end on each piece. Once separated, I put each piece in the water as a separate onion."
	- "I've done this for years. However, before placing in water, I quarter mine. They grow just as well, and instead of 1 onion I'll have 4. This can also be applied to potato eyes, celery, carrots, etc."
- Remove papery peel to reduce rotting chance. Leave the "shaved" root stems
- Put quarters root down inside containers. Bottom part must be submerged. Seems like top can be left exposed to air maybe?
- After about 7 days they start to get shoots and can be planted. Probably follow the same rules as below for planting.

### Regrowing Green Onions (& Leeks Probably?):
- When cutting Green Onions, save the whites
- Put white small bulbs in jarss of water, they will form roots, and start to form green stems
- They can then be planted in pots OR outside in Mar-May & Aug-Sept, full sun, bulb 1/4" down

### Conclusions
- Soil: rich, fine, well-drained all should work
- Depth: 1/4" is pretty universal. Lavender is barely covered, cat grass is broadcast
- Distance: plant pretty close at first, most have instructions to trim at heights, transplant to further apart, etc (look at packets)
- Water: lightly water, mist keep moist
- Sun: full sun except Chives, but I think the Chives will be fine. Full sun = 6 hours of sunlight
