- Don't sow when soil temperatures are wrong
- Soil covers using a garden planner (see video) can move the growing season forward

### Seed Starting Mistakes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZYE_JJWQI
- **Starting too early**
	- Start 4-6 weeks before **last frost date**
- **Heat** -- manage temperatures appropriately
- **Not having enough light**
	- If you have a south facing window that gets 6-8 hours of full direct sun every day, grow them there. Greenhouses too.
	- Without these, you need a grow lamp
	- It **doesn't** have to say "Grow light" -- it can be a light that gives you:
		- Lumens : 1500 - 2000 ; this is the intensity
		- Kelvin : 4500 - 6500 ; this is the color temperature
			- "Daylight" may be on this bulb
		- These values mimic the sunlight
- **Baby** your plants too much, causing them to be shocked by the outside when they go out.
	- Use a little fan to give them stem strength to simulate breezes
- **Watering from Above** -- they should be watered from below. Watering from above can cause gnats and all kinds of problems. A fan helps with this too, drying out the soil surface
	- Watering from below causes the roots to grow downwards.
- **Moving them fast** - eg moving them outdoors too fast. They have to be adjusted to the outdoors
	- They have to develop "sunscreen" or a thicker skin from the sun
	- Temperature fluctuations
	- **Hardening**
		- **Traditional process**: every day, take them outside a little bit more (hour in shade, 2 hours in shade, 3 hours partial sun, 4 hours partial sun, 5 hours full sun, 6 hours full sun, 7 hours full sun, 8 hours full sun)
		- **Easy Process**: plan on 3 full days when it will be **overcast weather** and set them out at the beginning of that 3 day period; bring them in overnight during the 3 day period, then plant on day 4
**Comment**: setting this up in the back storage room or my workbench area makes a lot of sense. The storage room gets some good sun exposure but not total sun exposure. A shelf of some kind (makeshift or otherwise) with a lamp that has a bulb like this would probably germinate seeds.


### Supplies I need
Sort this list into an alignment chart


```
```


- Lots of buckets
- Hoe
- Bricks (collect these, and then start blocking out actual bed shape)
- Bonemeal
- Thermometer for seed germination
- Hose spray nozzle for watering!
- Seed tray - maybe a single nice one or a few cheap ones
- Sunlight-style lamp if I can get it
- Heated mat / propagator
- Pots

#### Blossom End Rot
- Calcium Deficiency
- Inability of the plant to move calcium throughout itself


### Garden Bed Mistakes to Avoid
- Garden Facing: Face it **SOUTH** which is where our Garden is facing
	- Watch the sun
	- Suncalc.net -- kind of weird, but I should try and find a sun exposure calculation method
- Need to plan *some* kind of irrigation - hose it off if needed
- Not investing in soil: need GOOD soil -- bad soil can cause one season of good growth followed by compacting and nitrogen deficiency -- put the LARGEST amount of money in soil
- Not mulching - mulching seems like a necessary layer to garden soil to protect the plants


### Soil Food Web for Soil Quality:

- Long term soil quality improvement

#### Worm Bin
#### Coffee Grounds in Garden
- Nitrogen is not immediately plant available -- released over time in composting process

### Eggshell fertilizer
- Rinse
- Microwave for 2 minutes
- Grind into powder
- Don't use as a quick fix, but as a slow release
- (Could create soluble calcium with a vinegar)
- Put in compost piles
