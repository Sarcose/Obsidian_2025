### Supplies I need
- Lots of buckets
- Hoe
- Bricks (collect these, and then start blocking out actual bed shape)
- Bonemeal
- Thick garden gloves
- Hose spray nozzle for watering!

#### Blossom End Rot
- Calcium Deficiency
- Inability of the plant to move calcium throughout itself


### Garden Bed Mistakes to Avoid
- Garden Facing: Face it **SOUTH** which is where our Garden is facing
	- Watch the sun
	- Suncalc.net -- kind of weird, but I should try and find a sun exposure calculation method
- Need to plan *some* kind of irrigation - hose it off if needed
- Not investing in soil: need GOOD soil -- bad soil can cause one season of good growth followed by compacting and nitrogen deficiency -- put the LARGEST amount of money in soil
- Not mulching - mulching seems like a necessary layer to garden soil to protect the plants


### Soil Food Web for Soil Quality:

- Long term soil quality improvement

#### Worm Bin
#### Coffee Grounds in Garden
- Nitrogen is not immediately plant available -- released over time in composting process

### Eggshell fertilizer
- Rinse
- Microwave for 2 minutes
- Grind into powder
- Don't use as a quick fix, but as a slow release
- (Could create soluble calcium with a vinegar)
- Put in compost piles
