1. Leave some root tissue along with the leaf so it’s not an open wound, roots and new leaves will come from that white thin part. 
2. No rooting in water or dome required, it already has all the moisture it needs, just let it dry a couple of days so it heals and seals. 
3. 1 part soil / 1 part sand / 1 part manure, seldom watering or they’ll get thin and weak, lots of Sun! And they like to be crammed into each other.
4. After years trying to figure it out and overwatering, I gave up and abandoned it and it worked lol.
