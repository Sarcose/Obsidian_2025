It's important to understand the amount of money that will go into the garden **initially** as well as **over time.** It will also be important to **plan the investment ratio** for the garden -- don't spend a ton of money on unimportant parts of the garden! Don't buy huge tubs and then skimp on the soil for instance. Don't spend a ton of money on a super nice shovel when a decent one will do (or, since we already have one, don't buy one at all). Every spare (garden-allocated) dime should go into different things with **priorities** for more impactful things.
