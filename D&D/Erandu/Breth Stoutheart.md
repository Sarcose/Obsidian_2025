***You stand against my Lady. And thus, you stand against me.

***I commend your courage. Fight with honor, and you will all die with the dignity you deserve.**

***You believe me outnumbered? Only if you would consider yourselves masters.***

***For Xenta, I fight no longer. I am my oath, and my oath is to My Lady alone. Her whims are not mine to question.***

***I grant you all due accolades for destroying that creature finally, and setting My Lady free.***

***You seem to be mistaken, Tovena. If you are to stop Lady Laryssa, you will not simply have to defeat me. You will have to kill me.***

Laryssa has made it up to the fray, and placed a hand on her arm.
