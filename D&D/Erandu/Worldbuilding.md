### Hellebore
**The Dusty Corner** 
	*A used bookstore which is a front for Hellebore. It appears to be a quaint moderately-sized shack out of which sticks a decorative tree. Their windows close and door shuts tight and every bookshelf opens up to reveal double the books contained therein, swivelling outward until there is almost no room to move. There is a second card catalogue hidden inside the first, viewable by reading the card catalogue upside down. The librarians of Hellebore are obsessed with it.*
- **Sariel,** the leader of Hellebore and a study of materialist philosophy.  
- **Azureth**, the secret founder of Hellebore and a blue dragon in half-human form. She stays in the library at all times, hoarding her book collection. She stays fed with a little garden out back and also sends the other girls out for takeaway. She’s especially fond of mutton.  
- **Asherielle,** researcher of lost magicks – little old lady
- **Valtorus,** antiquities researcher  
- **Alastar Nvoriel,** who organizes meetings to make additions to the card catalogue. He is also a history researcher.

**Dr. Aile**, who has become a **Grimcaster** 



### Grimcaster
The goal of the psionic infusion experiments within the Old Bones, Grimcasters are Psi Slaves that have kept their sentience. Dr. Aile is an especially powerful one, having worked with the psionic energy for so long prior to being transformed. However, Dr. Aile possesses no more free will, as her brain has been partially consumed by the creature that chased them out of the Old Bones. This is what awaits the players when they make camp after fleeing Penrith.
Dr. Aile follows the players, attracted to Tove for vengeance and Gertie for the psionic powers she radiates, as well as Lusus' own.
**The Night of the camp** Gregor senses the approach of the Grimcaster and has a traumatic episode. He can be broken out of it by a DC 20 Medicine check or DC 20 Psionics check. Each failed check makes the DC go up by 5. During the traumatic episode he will swing wildly at everything around him, yelling "GRIMCASTER!", and then Dr. Aile will emerge.
An overwhelming sense of oppressive claustrophobia will envelop the players as she approaches. Tove must make a DC 15 Will Save or her cave trauma will return as she thinks she's inside a cave.
Gertie must make a DC 20 Will save or her brain will be overwhelmed with the psychic force - and this is the Grimcaster's true purpose.
The Grimcasters suppress the mind. The more attuned to psionics is the creature, the more suppressed. Grimcasters are Xenta's counter to the Wisdoms of Lasser in their campaign of wiping out the Wise Ways.
Lusus will revert to his pre-transformation barely humanoid form, looking like a smooth shadow barely physical.
