This document will serve as a general look at what it will take to leave Penrith for this next session, which we'll be doing tomorrow night. 

### Introduction:
*From the moment she arrived in Penrith, Tove has been hunting, and moreover, hunted. Bar fights, street skirmishes, infiltration, evading the authorities, sequestered from hideout to hideout, and even a jailbreak from an impossibly massive dungeon - in her time here she has become a source of rumor and speculation. Breaking bread with the disruptors of Hemlock, studying in the hidden library of a secret dragon and her cult of Hellebore, organizing within the soup kitchens, making plans with militant rebels in Wolfsbane... and here, now, she prepares herself. It is the eve before the festival - the High Horn's Jubilee, or the Festival of the High Horn. Districts have been sectioned off, town guards and Xentan soldiers - themselves sometimes nearly-indistinguishable - are patrolling in force. The orange of the sunlight begins to fade as you sit in the common room of your new base.

Lav: "In just the last week Tove has been working nonstop, and there is a strange comfort to Neriam house. Though it's clear that there is furniture just purchased and things are new, there is a comfort and Tove has worked incredibly hard to create it. Candle sconces on the walls. A table, oval, with chairs around it, bookshelves and various small nooks. Something important was creating a space that felt more like home - a home for anyone who needed a home."

*After some time, Mint attempts to sneak up to the base through a window. Tove has a chance of spotting them.*
Mint: "I needed to make sure I wasn't followed! *looks around and whistles* lookin' good in here boss!" "Okay, so's I was workin' at the church right, helpin' the sisters? And this man is standing in line, he's all dressed poor-like but he didn't stand like a pauper, aright? Big fella, too face like a fryin' pan. So I could tell this guys' kinda weird. I turn to Echo and I says 'ey yknow what's up with that fella eh?' but she's all distracted, right, talkin' to the sista ysee. So after he gets his food and finishes up and everything and we're supposed to be studyin' I slip out the back and go around the side a tha buildin' and put my eyeballs on him just like you told me to awright?"

"So he makes to leave only he's lookin' around, see, he keeps lookin' at my sista, he's about to head out and maybe make his way around to the courtyard sos I get my dagger out and put it behind my back and I tap him on the shoulda and I say 'ey mista whaddya watchin my big sista for? And then he turns around and says 'that your sista?' and I says "yeah whaddya want wit er" and he says "i'm lookin' for a woman named Tove, you familiar" so I says "who's askin?" and he says "I'm an associate of Lysander and we've been tryin to locate her" so I says "neva met er in my life!" and he didn't believe me but he tipped his hat to me and left me alone so I go inside and tell Echo and she said I betta run get you right away and she's gonna stay behind and make sure if he comes back she'll keep an eye out. An' an' I made sure I wasn't followed neitha!"

If Tove goes to the church to see if someone shows up it'll be the big guy Barnes and Lysander's lawyer, Mr Tom.

Mr. Tom: "Excuse me My Lady, pardon the interruption to your day, I understand you're very busy. You may or may not remember me from a dinner party we attended some time ago in the Westing Manse. The big guy here wasn't with me but I was accompanied by a more dapper gentleman, do you catch my drift?"  "And is there somewhere we can speak in private?"
"Thank you for taking the time to meet with me. My employer, one Mr. Lysander Nightengale, is as you can imagine eagerly awaiting a meeting with you in his private villa. We have been looking for an appropriate time to contact you, however at multiple points you seem to have employed a talent for disappearance. Is that familiar to you?" "You understand of course we couldn't just knock on the door of the Westing Manse, it would draw too much attention to either of us." "Now that I have your attention it is incumbent upon me to extend an invitation from my employer Mr. Nightengale to dine with him, this evening if possible given the circumstances."  "Lady Morntide, it would be prudent that we use as little language directly referencing the matter at hand as possible, but just understand that your employer and my employer keep in regular contact and he has your goals and interests in mind regarding this invitation."

*Tove accepts the invite*
Mr. Tom: *gestures to Barnes outside the door* "My man will be arriving shortly with a coach. At this time I will now inform you that we will be travelling in secrecy, you will need a way to conceal your entrance into the coach. You may bring a companion with you if you wish but you will be required to leave your weaponry somewhere safe and secure with my men or elsewhere prior to or at the moment of entry of the Villa grounds. Other than myself, my driver, and Mr. Nightengale's closest associates including your own benefactor, there are none in the city who know the exact route to the entrance of his private Villa. As such you are to keep your curiosity in check during the coach ride and refrain from opening the windows or looking outside. Upon the conclusion of the meeting you will be safely and respectfully escorted anywhere in the city of your choosing, even outside of it if you so wish - rest assured that for men like Mr. Nightengale, city guard blockades pose no barrier to travel."

*If asked about attire* Mr. Nightengale does prefer finery, however between you and me he is too polite to impose restrictions of that nature on his guests. You will be permitted an appropriate period to prepare yourself when you arrive if you wish to avail yourself of a guest room to freshen up and get changed. The decision is yours.

*During the carriage ride, if asked*
Mr. Tom: "I'm not at liberty to discuss the planned topics of the meeting at this time. I will most likely be present for the even, however."

Meet with Lysander:
	- "I had hoped for a long term business partnership, but the whispers suggest you will not be long for Penrith?" -- Lysander offers secret passage out of Penrith in exchange for a contact within Oleander

Ricca - a femme who identifies as he/him and dresses in a cloak and business attire, long brown tresses and smokes.


*At this point it seems unrealistic to expect Tove wouldn't sus out Ysabel's betrayal right away... although, if she's a dreadnought that would explain that there was some sort of mental shielding*
- Gertie and Tove summoned to Eva, Velka (Anarie), Gregor
	- Blossom, Kael and Ysabel are there and they are all prepared to talk about plans (btw Wolfsbane has an uneasy treaty with Blackthorns)
		- This year, for the first year ever, actual barricades have been erected around the city. They seem to be expecting something. When asked about them, the guards and Xentans, who are now working side-by-side, claim the barricades are to "create a safety area for the festival celebration" but that "just so happens" to barricade the most accessible roads into the city square and the merchant district.
		- Blossom and her people have been going throughout Oldtown fomenting excitement for the festival, getting people wanting to go despite the common tendency of the High Horn festival to be exclusionary to the older and poorer families. They have been recruiting people to help Oldtowners over the barricades and into the Merchant district early in the morning, before the actual guards are planning on posting up.
		- Kael and Ysabel have intelligence there is a new Dreadnought in the city, but he has not shown his face yet. He surely plans to be there at the festival.
		- Wolfsbane has been working with Hemlock as well as Echo and Mint of Oleander, and they have established a distribution network of supplies between Old Town, the Shanties, the Smallhomes, and the Old Dockside. Oleander's presence has enabled some of the commoners to successfully operate their fishing boats for their families, lessening the load on Our Lady's Homely Hearth.
		- The backup plan if things go awry and Tove can't get out of the town is that she can hide out in the shanties for a few days until Nightshade and Lysander can get her out.
	- Asheriel is there as well, as she has guidance on where they can go when they leave (another Luthox relic)
	- Anarie/Velka will be using the diversion to  escape the city to make for the Xentan border city of Sternhold to meet with a contact there.
	- Neriem House
	- Gregor 
	- The plan: there are multiple opportunities to capture the attention of the crowd. An anti-occupation protest is planned, to disrupt the festival. It can be silent or it can be loud - up to you. If we start it early in the day it gives us a chance to gather more momentum, but it also gives the authorities a better chance to respond. If we keep it silent until it's kicked off, it may be harder to gain momentum and there may be a chance some of the people who came to protest won't commit, but if it works it will have a bigger impact.
	- Festivities start at noon and go well into the night when fireworks are launched off. Flowers of the Sky is in on the plan and has arranged for fireworks the color of the Lasser flag. No one will be mistaken what it means. The festival starts with a great trumpet of the church's horns, and then there is a parade from the church grounds to the town square, then to the Merchant Square where the wealthiest merchants all give speeches for the year, typically heralding Lasser, the Senaedrin faith, and recently many of them paying honor to Xenta.
	- ---Tove's opinion: start protests when the speeches start, quietly
	- ---Tove's escape during the fireworks
	- ---Nightshade kidnapping the mayor

	- Asheriel gives parcel from Azureth to be opened outside the city, as well as maps of Lasser


	- Eva and Velka bid Tove come into their private chambers, (where Breth Stoutheart sits)
- Breth Stoutheart
	- Music "Erandu - Breth Survived"
	- *Eva holds the door open for you and Velka waits for you to enter. Through the door is a windowless room of bookshelves and purple incenses, lit bright by strong lanterns. At the end of the room is a modest desk with an oil lamp and several comfortable chairs, in which sits a large figure with their back turned to you. A musclebound woman with a scarf on her head, heavy red braids spilling out of it from behind. You recognize her crafty armor, a mix of leathers and metals, and her left gauntlet adorned with crackling bands of color. Leaning against a shelf is the remnants of a great hammer that seems to have a broken haft. As you enter you hear a raspy voice, some broken form of that strong voice you once knew to be Breth Stoutheart* "Is this the hospitality of the Lady of Penrith?"
		- Eva: "My apologies, Captain--"
		- "Sir, will do. A captain no more."
		- "Indeed, Sir. Again I thank you for waiting. It happens we have many guests today, and we are keeping you in secrecy for that cause."
		- "I appreciate that. You have brought some of those guests?"
		- "You may recognize some of them."
		- *The figure stands, the old chair she was sitting in complaining with loud creaks as she does so. As she turns her tattered cloak billows. You see that in addition to her gauntlet her left leg is now fully mechanical. And the scarf doesn't just cover her head - it is also hiding her eyes. Her head does not turn directly toward you, and it stays down slightly, as she angles her ears to better hear the room* "Indeed I do, young Lady Morntide. I am glad to know you are well."
		- Breth Stoutheart has come to share the secrets of Xenta. She has the names of many of the Dreadnoughts as well as their specialties, and also news of the Would-be Queen's movements. (see Breth's info below). Stoutheart will not linger for the festival, using the cover to travel with Velka into Xenta. When questioned about her blindness, she says "I will find a way."




## Breth's Info
**What happened:**
*That creature, Elag Vea's, soldiers proved little challenge for me, my lady. They could not have overwhelmed me alone even if they were twice as many. Nor did the letch himself stand and fight me. They were good sport for some moments before I was taken off-guard by something... more.*

When she speaks, it is matter-of-fact. Her words sound like bravado, but there is no pride in her voice. There is something else... regret, perhaps. You sense she is recalling this tale in the way that a master artisan might examine a mistake in his work.

*It is that noble woman, the Lady Katiana, you must forgive me for speaking ill of a Lasser highborn so. Something she did, whilst my attention was diverted - I have long whet my skills against beings of her power, but I did not expect she would turn it on me so. I erred, in assuming of her the grace of her standing, and all the more reason I am glad I did not permit you to stand at my side. Would that she had allowed me my honor, I would have submitted to her in the end, as is proper, but she at last proved herself anything but the Regality to which she claims.

*As I made fools of Elag Vea's toy soldiers there was a blinding flash behind me. I was too slow to subdue this new surprise, and it struck my weapon from my hand and snagged my gauntlet. Behind me then, a sword finally found its way in my leg, bringing me to my knees. I could have pressed more, but I allowed my attention to linger on Her Ladyship too long, trying to grasp what she was doing. Then I died.

*Except, as you can see, I clearly did not. And yet, I am still unwhole, as it stands.*

She takes a tentative step toward you, and in the flickering light you can see her face is scarred beneath the cloth, though most of it is obscured. Raising her chin, a wicked scar on her neck is revealed. It looks to encompass the majority of her neck, almost as if she were... you shudder to think. She traces a part of it with her fingers. *Based on my death wound, I would hazard a guess I had my throat ripped out. This would be the work of a larger predator, not a small one such as a wolf. The teeth marks are too vicious.* These words, she speaks without a hint of emotion to them.

**How did you come back to life?**
*This I do not know. I awoke in the same chamber you left me in, all living foes gone, including beast and Lady. All that remain were the bodies Elag's men - not enough to account for the full force that attacked me, and neither was his body there, and so I made to track them. I did not have time to question my survival. It was no more difficult to track them than a common caravan, for they were no longer making their travel secret - however, evidence of what happened to me, their travel revealed not. I followed them for a great distance northwest into Delune. I would have continued following her but I was intercepted by Eva's people, and took upon myself this new task.*

**What is the new task?**
You feel Eva looking at you. *I am afraid I will not divulge this, not to you nor anyone else. I have stopped here to give you information, a fighting chance in the days to come, and then I make east for Sternhold along with Velka.*

**Information**
- How Xenta is intending to aid Luciana - the plan was for Lunaris to be occupied by a Dreadnought, last she heard it was to be Voloz or Dahak. Of the two, she would be more wary of Voloz, whose machinery is designed to puppeteer the corpses of the fallen in mocking facsimile of life. From there, multiple legions are to be deployed to the different regions of Lasser, disguised as monarchist Lasser - "To that end, it seems reasonable to assume Dahak will be involved, as he has been taught the crafting of devices of misdirection and subterfuge and will have equipped his infiltrators with them."
- The occupation of Penrith - sometime soon a second Dreadnought should be arriving, if she hasn't already. "I know not who it is, but I suspect it may be Mariatin, and she is far more dangerous than Gabranth and less honorable. She has by far one of the most versatile tool sets of the Dreadnoughts. Her armor and equipment were constructed to the most exacting standards. Many in the higher ranks of the Imperiality defer to her as if she were the leader of the Dreadnought class, though they are supposedly equals amongst themselves - I have even known the Imperial Chancellor to bend to her whim. At any rate, I know not the full extent of her capabilities - be ready for anything."
- *Now she looks at Tove*: "Apologies for what I am about to tell you, my Lady. I knew not that you would be in Penrith. But if you have not already made this discovery yourself, I believe it to be absolutely pertinent: your father has been fostered into the Xentan military, and has been granted the coveted rank of Dreadnought in exchange for the promise of permanent Xentan installations within Lasser. My understanding has been that he will serve as a symbol of the Unification."
