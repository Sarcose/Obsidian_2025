"The Aurochs farmers claim there have been no beasts of burden rented for the parade this year. I wonder how they plan to pull it?"

**The Celestial Chariot:** 
The first float in the parade is a magnificent representation of the heavens themselves. Towering above the crowd is a celestial chariot crafted from golden-hued wood and adorned with intricate clockwork gears. In the chariot stands a majestic figure dressed in multi-hued raiment that reminds one of the Crystal Skies, surrounded by swirling constellations and planets. Attached by some marionette network is a trio of Clockwork angels with gossamer wings that soar around the chariot, playing the Dance of Winds you know so well from stories. The float emanates a soft hum in front while pipes in back emit a dark grey smoke.

**The Garden of Serenity:** 
Following closely behind is a float that appears to be a verdant oasis of tranquility. Lush, mechanical foliage in hues of emerald and jade cascade from the float's edges, and clockwork butterflies flutter around delicate blooms. At the center of this serene garden stands a life-sized clockwork tree, its branches adorned with gears that mimic the changing seasons. A brass bust of Harmonia, depicted in a state of contemplation, sits beneath the clockwork tree. As the float moves, subtle mechanisms release strong scents that wow and delight the crowd.

**The Forge of Faith:** 
A marvel of Xentan craftsmanship, the Forge of Faith is an enormous, moving anvil which dominates the center of the float, surrounded by skilled artisans and blacksmiths tirelessly crafting religious symbols. The rhythmic pounding of hammers echoes through the streets, synchronized with the float's movements. Harmonia is portrayed overseeing this sacred craftsmanship, a symbolic representation of the forging of faith.

**The Ethereal Observatory:** 
This float is a wondrous representation of the divine's connection to the cosmos. A colossal, rotating orrery at the heart of the float depicts the intricate dance of planets and stars. Clockwork astronomers, dressed in celestial robes, peer through telescopes and make subtle adjustments to the intricate mechanisms. As the float glides along, beams of light emanate from the orrery, creating a mesmerizing celestial display. Harmonia is portrayed as a wise astronomer, hands raised in contemplation, symbolizing the eternal connection between the divine and the celestial spheres. The float exudes an ethereal glow, capturing the awe-inspiring majesty of the night sky.

As this last proceeds forth, a massive globe in the center opens and there stand two massively armored figures side by side - you recognize Gabranth's armor, and there is another, equally as tall as he, garbed in armor of a dark and intensely wrought alloy, shining with blue crystalline veins spreading throughout it that glimmer in the sunlight.

Surrounding the Observatory are more marionettes, these that dance by themselves. They are not angelic, more fanciful and colorful, like mummers and jesters. They play music. (perception 15) and they are scanning the crowd, their eyes darting from face to face.
