**Echo and Mint** – at a young age, their family had a run-in with the Blackthorns and their father was killed, their mother went missing. It’s been a decade, and Echo has always taken care of their younger sister mint. Echo fell in with Hemlock in opposing Blackthorn activities in Old Town, and the two of them spend most of their time at the church so that Mint can learn her histories. Here, they volunteer for the soup kitchen. They live in the warehouse with Hemlock most of the time. They listen to a lot of gossip.
