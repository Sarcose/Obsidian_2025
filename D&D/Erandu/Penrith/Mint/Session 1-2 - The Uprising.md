The biting cold of a fall day traced fingers into the open parts of Mint's tunic as she pulled on already-tight laces idly, looking out across a quiet crowd. She had spent many hours and days looking out across the waters just beyond the dock. Birds diving down and back out to take unseen meals just beneath the surface. At times the water would becalm, and Mint always thought that would have been an ideal time for the birds to hunt - yet they never did. *"Watch your step when the water is calm - that's when the undercurrent is the strongest. Don't you dare get swept out into the water, because I'm the one who will have to get you and then we'll both drown!"* Her sibling had told them once.

The sea of *faces* was calm, today.

Mint sat perched atop a retaining wall like a gargoyle, an oversized coif pulled low over her face and hiding their eyes. Next to her, a junco hopped merrily across the bricks, looking for bugs and leavings. "Sorry little one, the pigeons always get the best pickings first thing. I might have something, though." With great care so as not to unbalance herself, Mint reached a hand clad in fingerless glove into a pocket, past buttons and stones and a knife, to find some seeds at the bottom.

Peering into the misty gloom Mint could see a quiet bustle. Tents and stalls were being erected, and from what she could see people seemed to be preparing for rain. A great many of the shapes milling about were recognizable - to Mint, anyway - as Oldtowners. "Swarthies" the uptowners would call them. She tried to make out some specific faces but from this angle it was hard to say. A few of them stood out though - there was the angry bonfire of Blossom's hair, for instance. Mint warmed, seeing her, and almost waved, but then remembered what she'd been told. 

*"You can NOT be seen today."*

Normally these admonishments didn't mean much to Mint - grown ups were always coming up with new rules, and Echo seemed to play right along with them. But this had come from Tove, the Boss of Nerium House. And Mint would be moritifed to disappoint her.

Here in the mist, above the square and hidden amongst the foot traffic of the Pike Road Bridge, it was easy to avoid being seen. A sudden urge took her, though, and she looked up - sure enough, there was the high road Aldman's Way, at the edge of the Laeran District, literally looking down on the Market Square. And revelers were beginning to gather.

If she were to truly see everything, Mint would need to get higher.





*Lady Eva hasn't reported.*

You remember a conversation, overheard, just a half-span ago. Thora's voice: *"Take to the roofs today. The higher the better. Lady Eva has not reported in."

But... the parade is about to start!

Lady Eva: there's a name spoken in whispers. You've had never met her. Whoever she was, you're slightly frightened. In Oleander's most secretive moments, in Tove's darkest dealings and negotiations, and in the most dangerous situations - Lady Eva was never far from the lips of people with far more reach and influence than you've ever imagined. Whoever she was, she was a phantom, and she always made you feel as though you were in the company of powerful movers and shakers, people who could change the very world. You felt proud and safe to be a part of it.

And now that name was used to speak something dreadful.

There was another voice then. A lighter masculine voice, like your sibling Echo's, but one that was silkier and brooding. It hid a deep history and a dangerous capability. *"Lysander has sent no communication as well. This is unlike him."* Ricca, the newest member of Oleander. And as well, a name that was associated with fear.

You know all these things, because you are a good listener.



And now, back in the present, perched on a retaining wall beneath Aldman's Way, as you can hear the music and explosions of the parade winding its way toward the Market Square from across the city... what do you do?





# State of the City
Penrith is currently undergoing the High Horn Festival, and we open on Mint perched on the Pike Street Bridge retaining wall above the Market Square. Behind her is Pike Street, which winds its way through the Smallhomes. Pike Street has much foot traffic as people jostle to get a view of the parade, but its a shoddy view - until it reaches Market Square, no one will be able to see much of anything, and it's a bad angle. To the east the city goes effectively downhill whereas the Laeran District is uphill to the west. 

*You recognize a metaphor about something rolling downhill, and look across the east to see your home district at the lowest point of the city, across the bridges*


Mint is essentially planning on searching for Lady Eva, which involves going to her house unseen. She can go across rooftops or slip their way through the Smallhom



Make a DC 16 Acrobatics check.
**Flashback**
**Success OR Fail:** *You're still smarting from the little tumble you took on the way up the wall. It's a route you've taken many times, that other neighborhood kids didn't know about. Always looking for more back-ways and passages, however, you found a particular spot where two leaning homes cross the gap between Lowtown and the Market. As you made your way up the familiar ascent, an unbidden twinge in your ankle forced you to adjust and you rolled against a loose gutter, scrambling your way up the wall, life flashing before your eyes. All the words of your sibling come rushing back to you. "You can't keep climbing around like this, Mint. It's dangerous." You can sense their unspoken words about your Troubles. The problem with your joints no one else but you seems to have. You bristle at her words, and at the memory.

*Your side hurts more than your ankle, though. That pain came and went - an old familiarity. But because you had to brace against your side you can feel your body weight making your ribs ache.*



Now here in the present, you have two choices. You could slip into the crowd, either up on Pike Street or down in the Market, or you could continue scrambling up through roofs, gaining you a better vantage point of the parade.

- Mint wants to Laeran district to see what's going on
- *Mint feels important because she went with Tove to see Lysander*
- Go back through Smallhomes way - down Pike Street
- Listens to see if she can find Wolfsbane -- Perception check 21 - no one is saying anything about anyone important
- "Do I know anyone who works in the Laeren District and lives in the Smallhomes?"
	- Investigation 10
	- Tedry, son of Tedrick Wilks
	- Threw rocks at the window until Miss Wilks
- 

Make way to Eva's manor. These are done in any order.
	- [x] Sneak checks, to get past guards
	- [x] Performance check or Acrobatics to escape: "You there, girl!" a nobleman who mistakes her for a parade servant.
	- [x] Asking for Directions or Survival to find Eva's Manor -- Mint chose Survival, rolled a 14
	- [ ] Barricaded pathways in the Laeran District. Survival to get around or otherwise.
	- [x] Deception checks or Investigation --> Asking for information
In Eva's Manor
	At the property
	- [x] Stealth 24, discovered upper window, discovered soldiers are with the High Inquisitor
	- [x] Constitution to push past pain, nat 1, level of exhaustion tomorrow
	- [x] Advantage on Athletics to climb as the Con check indicates pushing self too hard -- wrist injury tomorrow. "I feel my wrist pulling out of the socket just a little every time I put my hands on the wall to climb and I can feel it spike down to my elbows and I just keep saying 'Tove Chose YOU' and push past it. There is a continual aching from my wrists to my elbows but I get up to the window."
	- [x] Look then tuck and roll into window - Per 19, Acro 18
	- [x] In an empty guest bedroom.
	- [ ] Investigation check to find out what happened
	- [ ] "You certainly don't look like a soldier."
	- [ ] Look through documents in kitchen, in old mason jar buried in flour
	- [ ] "You don't look like a soldier." this time it's another soldier. Depending on amount of time spent we may go to combat or may wait for next session






Letter from KG:

Sister,

I hope this letter finds you well. I myself am not. Regrettably, the Holy Ecclesiarch has once again denied your asylum request for your friend to return to Xenta. Nor indeed have I been able to make any headway on your property in the countryside - I fear your trust in me has been misjudged, as I am afraid I am not equal to the task.

I write of a more grave matter: the Prelate of the Sacred Grove has arrived in Penrith far in advance of the festival. Her arrival was of utmost secrecy, and I regret i have not had time to finish this missive for over a week, due the care and crafting it takes.

Moreover, she has brought with her the Grand Inquisitor, ostensibly on a curiosity tour, but you must have feelings about this that go beyond my ken. You are already aware of the presence of hidden Justicars within the city walls - at last we have learned their purpose: they have been collecting information in secret, using no written notes that we can discern, and upon the GI and the Prelate's arrival, they have amassed at the church and have been in secret meetings for days. For this reason I have finally been granted some solitude with which to craft this communication.

Thus I say: you need to get out. What I have heard, they have pointed out Mr. Lysander, and if his dealings are traceable I am afraid yours have not been as secret as you suspected. The truth is more sinister than we imagined, for the Law of Xenta has crossed with the Clergy here in a most direct manner.

I beg you, meet me the night of the festival. As I cannot be sure you will get this in time, I eagerly await a sign from you prior to this arrangement. Should you not respond I will optimistically assume you have arranged for your flight, and to that I bid you a most dreadful farewell, and good fortune.

Yours,
KG




# Session 2
Mint was found out and is escaping. She attempted to set a fire to the cellar to burn the evidence and took the letter with her. She is running down the tunnel that leads into the culvert just outside in the Laeren District. 

- [ ] Escape Sequence. A tunnel that leads to several different collapsed dead ends, and eventually out into the culvert down the road, to a bridge that goes from the Smallhomes into Laeren. 
	- [ ] Staying on the right hand side hugging the wall. 
- [ ] Caught by a Bound Guard

## Bound Guard
*Warriors of the Inquisitor*
The Bound Guard are a later experiment of the Empire, beyond the knowledge of Eva and the rest. The Old Bones is not the only place where experiments take place. Appearing at first like a normal soldier, when in desperation they twist something implanted within their fragmented minds and take on an animalistic aspect. 

#### Combat Phase 1: "You're just a little kid! Is this what they call revolutionaries these days?"

A normal soldier. AC 16, HP 16, PER +2, ATHL +2,
Longswd: +2 To Hit, 1d8 damage slashing
*Mint has the advantage here. The Bound Guard is fighting at a disadvantage due to the slippery terrain.*
*During this phase something in the air makes her begin to feel a bit queasy.*

Initiative:
Soldier | Mint
0. Surprise round Mint Sneak Attack fail | Bonus Action Hide 
1. Soldier, scared, swings wildly | Mint sneak attack fail, hide broken BA Disengage slide past him get ten feet away
2. Soldier sheathes sword to command her to come with him, Mint gets a free sneak attack | success 19 Damage OHK


<= 6 HP or Mint tries to escape
#### Combat Phase 2: "Gotta hand it to ya kid, you're more than meets the eye."
*You feel a shift in the air, like a tension tightening to a wound spring. In the sickly pale light the shadowed figure of your assailant briefly shakes his torso, like a shudder going through him. His shadow seems to blur momentarily, almost as if the light source is going out, then upon its return you see there he stands, awash in a red-hue. It is as if wisps of red smoke swirl from within his form.* 
"The Inquisitor will wish a word with you, Girl."
*When he takes a step toward you his body moves in unusual ways, ways that make your own bones ache. If he is even still alive, and not some bogeyman of your nightmares, he will surely feel some terrible pain in the morning - if even he is ever able to return to his previous demeanor. It is as if he possesses some aspect of being that doesn't belong there. Doesn't belong to humanity. Are all of them like this?*
Transfigured:

0. Guard misses and transfigures | Mint attacks and misses, 17. Insightful fighting Bonus Action Per vs. damage.
1. Guard attack and misses   |  Mint attacks 20 hit called shot vs 20 AC 8 Damage 10 HP left
2. 
##### Transfigured Guard - Level 1 Transfiguration
AC 18, HP 18, PER +4, ATHL +4
Actions:
Longswd: +3 to Hit, 1d8+4
*Darkvision*
Sicken: *(3 Per LR)* The TG chooses one target engaged in Melee combat with him. That target must make a Constitution Saving Throw (DC 15) against breathing in the red smoke emanating from him. On a failure, the target is Poisoned (Disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Ability Checks). The target must repeat the Constitution Save each round to end the Poisoned condition.

Reactions: 
*Push Through The Pain:* 
The creature may use its reaction to damage to ignore the pain, taking 0 damage and turning it into *Double Repayment Temporary HP*. Any damage to this Temp HP is doubled onto him if said Temp HP is reduced to 0. This ability may not be used while already possessing Temp HP. (Arcana or Insight DC 10 to determine the nature of this interaction). While in possession of this Temporary HP he will act as if in a rage, unable to take combat actions that are not simple interactions and attacks. His Perception Checks are at disadvantage.


*Unto Death, and Beyond:* 
As a reaction to fatal damage (unless dealt while incapacitated or as a result of the blowback from Push Through The Pain), the creature may spend all of his remaining hit dice to roll to gain *Fading Temporary HP* - each round, he loses 1 point of this HP until he dies. It cannot be healed. During this time, he can be saved if he is healed an amount greater than the *original total of that Temp HP*. While this is ongoing his wounds will open more and more and his smoke will dissipate through them, giving him disadvantage on attack rolls as he pushes himself so hard he falls apart. Disadv Per, unable to take tactically complex combat actions (see above).


- [ ] Mint successfully hobbles him then runs, he is running and hurting himself in doing so. Running in the dark from him. Skill challenge. Choose a sense (5 checks):
			Mint                                      |                Bound Guard

	- [ ] Smell - Survival DC 14     12 Fail   |           Draws Nearer
	- [ ] Acrobatics - DC 13           13        |            Keeps pace
		"You come to a junction --V"
	 - [ ] Perception - DC 16         13     
	 Bonus Action Hide Stealth Check
	 
- Keep walking --- Nat 20 Perception hear fireworks
- Finds corpse - stealth check 22
- Con save vs Acrid unholy smell nat 1 vomits
- Investigation search body 11 finds:
	- Pewter figure (below)
	- His armor is a part of his body, in a way you can't determine
	- Bone Senaedrin handle dagger. Religion DC 20 to figure it out --- takes the dagger
				- (Stab it into yourself to transfer 3d6 HP from yourself temporarily to the Dagger, which can then be stabbed into another to gift to them, using the *Double Repayment Temp HP* rule above)

When he dies he dies clutching something at his chest - a necklace of beads, with a pewter figurine of the upside down, bound Senaedrin, bloody from his grip.

- [ ] Mint heads for safety
	- Emerging from the Culvert she will either try to find Eva or head back to Neriem house for safety, or try to find someone in the festival.
	*Fireworks are crackling in the sky, and feet rush all around above. You are thankful for the noise and chaos, because it gives you an opportunity to hide. You hear explosions, you see the red of flames in the distance. You hear orders being shouted, and you hear your own people crying out. The plan is underway, and the people have been driven into a fervor.*
- [ ] Most likely heading to the church. Choice:
	- [ ] Everyone knows their way to the Senaedra. You wager you can take this drain culvert most of the distance. (Survival checks to recognize streets above, advantage)
	- First Survival -- 16
	- Person falls off the bridge - it's not a guard, kicks sharp rocks out of the way
		- Dead. "Hey! Girl!" from up above.
		- Performance w/Adv 13 "My Da! My Da!"
		- Distracted, can leave
	- Second Survival -- 9, gets lost
	- Reorient -- Athletics to climb to get a view 12 can climb up
	- Perception Advantage -- 22
	- Stealth w/advantage to get back down -- 14
	- Survival w/advantage -- dirty 20


- Mint has her mother's prayer beads!

### The Senaedra
*The great steeples tower high into the sky, illuminated in the continual flickering of firework and the red flames of a city burning like spindles piercing luminescent cloth. Striking an imposing figure with statues of Senaedrin and blinded, deafened, muted supplicants begging to her for mercy and death, the Great Church of Penrith has always been a place you swore you would avoid. In your studies you have learned of wonderful deeds done by those who dwelled and served within those hallowed walls, and yet always a lingering dread remained in your mind when you thought of it. 

*"Church is a place of Faith and Family, and Community." The words of the Sisters are drilled into you. But here now, framed now in this sinister and imposing series of glows, it is anything but.* 

*In the distance, you can see many figures surrounding the normally lively and open courtyard. Where Eva's house was merely watched, The Senaedra appears to be practically quarantined. Standing in the gateway is a massive figure in large, imposing armor, wrought in many angry flourishes and with a massive helmet obscuring their identity. They appear to be conversing with another member of their coterie, shorter, in what could only be described as "normal plate mail" by comparison, a phrase you never thought you'd hear yourself thinking. They speak for a moment, and then the terrible armored being disappears inside the massive doors of the church, which are then shut with a crack so loud you can hear it all the way out on the street.

*Tapping into the Latent You*
Mint's journey to the church and her experience with the horrifying creature in the tunnel have given her the benefit of great insight into herself. She is able to level up to 4 prior to entering the Senaedra, however she does not gain the benefit of recovered health - she can, however, utilize her hit dice in a short rest.
