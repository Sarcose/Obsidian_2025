In the ancient, cobbled streets of the Senaedra, adorned with the timeless grace of stone arches and ivy-clad buildings, a sacred aura stirs in the air. The occasion is one of piety and celebration, a grand parade honoring Harmonia of the High Horn whose teachings had woven themselves into the very fabric of the faith. As the sun's golden fingers crest the high sky, casting a warm glow upon the city, the denizens prepare for a spectacle to unfold like a tale spun from the loom of the Scripts themselves.

The dwellings along the parade route were transformed into living tapestries, each building draped in richly hued fabrics bearing the symbols of wings, blindfolds, and the trumpets of Harmonia. Elaborate carvings of angels adorn doorways, and intricate silken knots that touch upon something cultural and forgotten, grace the arches. In the spirit of the Fallen, craftsmen have fashioned wooden carvings depicting scenes from Harmonia's life, intricately detailed and imbued with the essence of devotion.


In the spirit of hobbit hospitality, the quaint inns and taverns along the route had donned rustic charm, displaying banners depicting scenes from the revered figure's teachings. The aroma of hearth-cooked meals wafted through the air, inviting passersby to share in the mirthful camaraderie that mirrored the warmth of the Shire's homely gatherings.

At the city square, beneath the silhouette of a towering stone fountain reminiscent of the Argonath, the grand feast awaited. Tables groaned under the weight of hearty fare, echoing the feasts of the great halls in Rohan. A fellowship of diverse dishes, reflecting the richness of Gondor's bounty, invited all to partake in the communion of sustenance and shared joy.

Thus, the city embraced the sacred narrative woven into its very stones, honoring its religious figure with a tapestry of decorations that mirrored the essence of a Middle-earth imbued with both piety and artistry.



 
The mansions of the Laeren District have been transformed into veritable palaces of celebration, where many noble families would hold private parties later that evening as the parade would wind to a close. The grandeur of the noble houses was heightened by cascading banners, each a masterpiece of craftsmanship that told tales of ancestral lineage and heraldic pride. These resplendent emblems flutter like the standards of old, announcing the noble lineage of each household. Embroideries of gold and silver adorned the rich fabrics, shimmering in the sunlight like the mythic treasures beneath the rocky lands in the ancient caverns of Erandu.

Elaborate floral arrangements adorn the entranceways. The architecture, with its soaring spires and intricate stonework, invokes a sense of grandiosity and opulence. Elaborate stained glass windows adorn these mansions and give a sense of a blending of Xentan and Lasser styles, and far beyond their arched pathways their verandas are decorated with cloth streams and flags as they ready themselves for what promises to be a night of revelry.
