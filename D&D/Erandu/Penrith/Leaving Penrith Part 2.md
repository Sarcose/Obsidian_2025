### *Thoughts*
We are about to encounter High Horn Festival. The ultimate gist of the session tomorrow is that Tove is going to use the festival to spur a protest into revolution which is supposed to end in the people taking Penrith back from Xenta and corrupt Lasser.

Original Timeline: Festivities start at noon and go well into the night when fireworks are launched off. Flowers of the Sky is in on the plan and has arranged for fireworks the color of the Lasser flag. No one will be mistaken what it means. The festival starts with a great trumpet of the church's horns, and then there is a parade from the church grounds to the town square, then to the Merchant Square where the wealthiest merchants all give speeches for the year, typically heralding Lasser, the Senaedrin faith, and recently many of them paying honor to Xenta.


Basic breakdown of events:
- Early morning (*narration*) smallfolk from Oldtown make their way into the Market District where festivities will be held at the end of the parade, and begin camping out. 
```
----------Morning Narration----------
	*Morning frost from the late Autumn cold spreads its fingers across windows and orange-red leafy trees throughout the city of Penrith. There is a quiet hush across the city as preparations are made for the day's festivities: the High Horn Festival, celebrating Harmonia of the High Horn. Through your research in the Dusty Corner and conversations with its attendants, including Asheriel this past evening, you had gleaned that Harmonia was considered a major figurehead of the spreading of the Fosters of Senaedrin in Eastern Lasser and Western Xenta from before these countries had solid borders, when their borders were continually in flux. In many ways, Harmonia may have once stood as symbol of the modern oligarchical establishment of Penrith, but this meaning seems to be lost on the revelers of the day.
	
	*In the Market amongst the street sweepers and merchant stall constructions, already you see the 'Swarthies' of Old Town mingling about, readying themselves. Many of them are wearing their best clothes, some not much more than rags, some dusting off ill-fitting colorful garments from an older lineage of a more prosperous time. Here and there in the mingling crowds you see Blossom and the other members of Hemlock. They're chatting, passing out early morning meat sticks and rolls, and generally keeping the mood jovial amongst the poor. Other than the workers setting up the square, no one else has made it out here yet.* 

----------Encounter----------
	During the early morning town guards are harassing groups of Oldtowners trying to get them to leave when they have every right to wait there. "The Merchants are setting up their tents for the festivities and we're sectioning this portion off" - that is a lie, there is no code or law in place preventing people from assembling for the festivities early. Tove can solve this in a number of ways but make sure it doesn't turn to violence. 
```

 - Festival begins in Senaedrin District with the Trumpets of Harmonia ringing out from the church and the parade beginning.

 ```
 ----------Beginning of Parade Narration----------
	Beginning

The parade begins with large, ornate banners depicting scenes from the life of Harmonia. Icons of the Fosters and the High Horn Trumpets are carried by procession members.
Dressed in richly embroidered vestments, the clergy leads the parade, showcasing the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the city. High-ranking religious officials, including the Bishop himself, are adorned in elaborate robes and headpieces that you recognize from your studies but have never truly seen up close.
A group of skilled musicians accompanies the parade, playing traditional religious hymns on instruments like lutes, harps, and trumpets. The air is filled with chants and music as the procession approaches.
	
	The Senaedrin District:
In the ancient, cobbled streets of the Senaedra, adorned with the timeless grace of stone arches and ivy-clad buildings, a sacred aura stirs in the air. The occasion is one of piety and celebration, a grand parade honoring Harmonia of the High Horn whose teachings had woven themselves into the very fabric of the faith. As the sun's golden fingers crest the high sky, casting a warm glow upon the city, the denizens prepare for a spectacle to unfold like a tale spun from the loom of the Scripts themselves.

The dwellings along the parade route were transformed into living tapestries, each building draped in richly hued fabrics bearing the symbols of wings, blindfolds, and the trumpets of Harmonia. Elaborate carvings of angels adorn doorways, and intricate silken knots that touch upon something cultural and forgotten, grace the arches. In the spirit of the Fallen, craftsmen have fashioned wooden carvings depicting scenes from Harmonia's life, intricately detailed and imbued with the essence of devotion.

	 The Laeren District:
The mansions of the Laeren District have been transformed into veritable palaces of celebration, where many noble families would hold private parties later that evening as the parade would wind to a close. The grandeur of the noble houses was heightened by cascading banners, each a masterpiece of craftsmanship that told tales of ancestral lineage and heraldic pride. These resplendent emblems flutter like the standards of old, announcing the noble lineage of each household. Embroideries of gold and silver adorned the rich fabrics, shimmering in the sunlight like the mythic treasures beneath the rocky lands in the ancient caverns of Erandu.

Elaborate floral arrangements adorn the entranceways. The architecture, with its soaring spires and intricate stonework, invokes a sense of grandiosity and opulence. Elaborate stained glass windows adorn these mansions and give a sense of a blending of Xentan and Lasser styles, and far beyond their arched pathways their verandas are decorated with cloth streams and flags as they ready themselves for what promises to be a night of revelry.

	 Smallhomes:
The trees that line the avenues wear crowns of intertwined blooms, creating an arboreal procession that whisper tales long forgotten, of the ancient forests that came before. Fragrant blossoms perfume the air, and floral garlands dance in the gentle breeze.

	 Penrith Square:
Here describe the four floats.
	 Market:
```
- During the parade, they will attempt to find and apprehend members of the resistance, particularly Tove. Tove will receive a runner stating that Lady Eva did not make her rendezvous and Velka has already left with Breth the prior night. Kael is nowhere to be seen. Gregor is unable to achieve the same objective as he does not have an in with the Mayor like Eva does, so he is securing Tove's exit.

*A speech is given lauding Senaedrin and Harmonia, Penrith and Lasser as is usual. Gabranth stands by the speaker. At the end of the speech the second Dreadnought, the one in the dark blue-veined armor, stands up. Where the previous speaker was clearly only speaking out to the crowd that could hear him, this voice booms out all around the market square. It seems to come from everywhere at once. (perception 10) spread throughout the crowd are the marionettes that danced along the parade. This person's voice booms, a female voice with an accent you can't place. Insight 16 - it's intentionally distorted and you can't make it out.*
### Mariatin
"Good morrow to all Lasser and Xenta from near and far! And a very warm welcome you have given us on this most auspicious and holy day! To those of you who do not yet know me, I am High Commander Mariatin, Dreadnought of the Xenta-Lasser Liberation Force, and together with High Commander Gabranth we have come to your fair city and its wonderful hospitality, to partake in your beautiful culture and see all that Lasser has to offer!

"I am most pleased to announce this High Horn Festival, that the Rightful Queen of Lasser has officially reached out to Xenta, and as supporters of Lasser heritage and Lasser determinism, Xenta has responded! Even now, reinforcements are being sent into Lasser to continue securing territory for Her Highness, Luciana Katsua Du Lahstra, to take her rightful place upon the long-deposed throne of Lasser!" *cheers erupt around you, and you realize that many of the cheering figures are marionettes and Xentans. Make a charisma check to communicate with the crowd to begin booing*

*Perception 15 - soldiers begin appearing on the rooftops*

"To begin this evening's festivities, I have a treat for you all - we have even now begun to root out the elements of corruption and bureaucracy that have been choking the people of Lasser for too long, and today I am proud to bring you the greatest prize of this campaign, the great mastermind and orchestrator of the violence and fear you have experienced these past decades!"

- Lysander in a hood is brought onto stage, as he has been arrested.

"Fear no longer, for the great criminal empire of the Nightengale Company will be broken, starting with the Grand Don himself! There will be many more of these days to come. Already we have begun rounding up the extortionists throughout the city.

"Indeed, Mister Nightengale. Many more days of prosperity with you behind bars, wouldn't you say?"

Lysander looks up at her, his face bloodied, his eye blackened. "I daresay there will indeed be many days *exactly* like this."

A gauntleted hand slams him in the face and he goes flying onto the ground. You hear the sickening crunch of bone and see droplets of blood actually go flying. His breaths come ragged. "That mouth of him will get him in a great deal of trouble without his minions to back him up, eh?"

*Xentans cheer.*

Lysander is scooped up, and he says no more as he is hauled off.

"Now I will turn the stage over to the many illustrious merchants of your fine city! Let us ring in this Festival for a Prosperous New Age for Lasser!" *Cheers*

As Mariatin and Gabranth exit the stage, the marionettes begin dispersing from their stations in the crowd and head out to the boundaries of the Market, where they begin dancing and piping in music - and also watching. On the rooftops, you see the characteristic hat and cloak of Ricca flash for a moment, then disappear behind the guards.



### The Mayor
Tove was meant to give a speech in the place of the Mayor, yet it is clear he is still there. He steps up to the podium to give his speech. Tove can attempt to subdue him beforehand, during, or convince him to step aside.


### Tove's Speech
After Tove's speech the crowds begin rioting and just as anticipated, Gabranth is there. Gregor clashes sword with him, while Raptor runs up to whisk Tove away. Raptor's face is red and angry, streaked with tears - Kael has been arrested, betrayed by someone on the inside. Raptor signals to the resistance who begin firing off the subversive fireworks so bright they blind the soldiers looking for Tove. She leads Tove and Gertie into the tunnel network, and Gregor meets them quickly.


	Beneath the shroud of night, a drainage tunnel unfolds, clandestine passages carved beneath the city's labyrinth of streets. As you step through the low archway, the corridor opens into a walkable expanse, where shadows play upon the uneven stone floor slick with moisture. Torches flicker along the walls, casting ephemeral light upon worn stones, revealing the clandestine journey ahead. The air is thick with the scent of age, and the rhythmic drip of unseen water creates a haunting melody, echoing through the subterranean passages.

*Gregor: "Raptor! It is worse than we imagined. They must have had us infiltrated for months to be this prepared. They are allowing the revolution to proceed so they can make an example of the rioting."
Raptor: "Kael is in chains and Ysabel is nowhere to be found, but Wolfsbane still stands strong. We will not let them get away with this."
Gregor: "If you are not successful, Xenta will use this to further their narrative and begin rounding people up."
Raptor: "It will not happen. The Penrith Underground is not just a few people. We will mourn our losses and we will continue fighting."
Gregor: "I should expect no less." 
Gregor: "Meanwhile, I have heard nothing from Eva. It is clear her plan to subdue the Mayor was not a success. Simply failing is not like her - we must assume she has been held up in some way, or worse. If she has been revealed, her estate is no longer available to us. A runner has been sent to Velka to recall her so she can resume command of Nightshade."


(Skill Challenge: crawling through sewage, avoiding running boots up above)
	
	The crawling passage lets out to a larger drain tunnel several hundred meters long, tall enough now to move through while crouched. The sounds of fighting are far off but you can hear the repeated explosions of fireworks above. Now at the end of your escape, you see them flashing the night sky outside at the end. 
#### Mariatin Reveals Herself
*Raptor crawls out first and you hear a gasp. The bodies of Wolfsbane warriors are littered about the craggy rocks of the drainage stream leading out into the field. "What has happened here??"

Ysabel's voice, now accented: *"Truly, Raptor? Have I eluded you this well for so long?"*

*Raptor turns, at first elated, and then a look of horror on her face. Stepping out of the shadows is Ysabel, clad in the armor of Mariatin.* "SISTER!??? YOU are the Dreadnought?"

**You can feel and see the silhouettes of figures lurking just out in the shadows. You count at least five. Given Mariatin's stance, she seems aware of their presence. **

Mariatin's voice now. She sounds pitying, almost remorseful. She looks down at the dead Wolfsbane members: "*The things we do for love, sister. The love I have, is not the love of high-minded ideals, but the love of the people.* She looks up at Raptor *But I am sorry... Ysabel never existed. She was planted into yours and Kael's minds. Yet, the kinship I felt for you as sisters is no less real. In the end, I came to feel as though you had adopted me, even if you didn't realize that's what this was. 

*And this is why I feel terrible about what I must do. There is no need for so much blood to spill, Dear Raptor. If you could only see what I see. Xenta has been victorious for decades now - they simply haven't made it public. It is useless for Wolfsbane to carry on with this. Yet none of you have ever listened to my pleas for peacemaking.*

**Tove opportunity to talk**

*"Now. All of you will drop your arms, and you will come with me. It is not too late for you, my sister. I am empowered to pardon you. And you, Sir Gregor, an honorable Knight of Lasser. There is no need for you to continue associating with this criminal and dissident. You will earn your pardon as well, should you come quietly."

Raptor: **voice shaking with barely contained rage, speaking through her teeth** "*I will RIP THE WORD SISTER OUT OF YOUR DEVIL'S MOUTH!!!!"* she draws her sword and Ysabel catches it in the spines of her gauntlet, drawing her sword in kind.

Mariatin: "ARREST LADY MORNTIDE, KILL THE OTHER TWO!"
