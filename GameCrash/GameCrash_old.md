For now this will be a catch-all document for all my Game Crash notes, until I get my personal Obsidian set up.

### Outer Pixels

##### Epistolary Gameplay Storytelling
There is a theory I am crafting about "modern day epistolary" storytelling. It begins with 3D Workers' Island (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlFpoZLsELc and  https://mryes.itch.io/3dwiscr) and also somewhat describes the narrative structure of Homestuck. The premise is this:
```
In Outer Pixels, we have a framework for storytelling through the dialogue system - forum posts, social media, and messages. Taking a step back, let's examine how we can expand on the story through the Epistolary format.
```

Now, that being said, there is an immediately identifiable issue that I am able to touch on with the incorporation of this format into the story of Outer Pixels:
**The Story of Outer Pixels as it currently stands doesn't matter**

What does that mean? Why would I say that about my own work? It's true. Most of my stories have always been generic fantasy escapism. Yet is that what captures me? What am I inspired by primarily in my pursuit of scifi and cyberpunk dystopic fiction?
- Bladerunner, the story of a group of artificially manufactured humans who struggle to find their place in the world
##### Strangers
- **Bodyplans**: "slenderman" "eversion" "large shoulders" "leaning back" "mouth only" "many limbs" "no orifices" "crab claws" "ghostly"
##### Animation plans
- Portraits
	- Note: *all* bodies will have portraits. All of them.
	- Facial Expressions: only specific sprite assets are included below. There are some generics as such:
		- Generics: Shaking, Upside down, spinning, flying all over the place -- these are transformation effects
		- Expressions:
			- Sentients: Neutral, Surprised, Disgusted, Angry, Sleepy
				- (humanoids)
			- Robots: Neutral, Glitchy (robotic forms of other creatures will access "neutral" and "sleepy" probably)
			- Strange Form: idk, lots of different ones probably.
			- Outsider: Neutral only, animated with some wavy hood stuff
			- Strangers: (Sentients) + "Sadistic"
			- Basic Creatures: May just use transformations for now.
				- (speye, froog, wisp, birdbrain, dropbat, jackodemon, madpetals, dogg, pider, rabball, sneach)
