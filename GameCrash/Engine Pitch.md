**GameCrash Engine** is the baseline framework underpinning all GameCrash games.  
It is built from the ground up around the concept of **modular identity** — where entities and actors are composed from structured, data-driven components.

Physics systems and design rules are fully customizable and live-tweakable, giving designers deep control over how entities behave and interact.  
Game worlds exist within a 2.5D recursive topology that supports both Euclidean and non-Euclidean design — as literal or abstract as a game requires.

This approach is central to games like _JumpySpaceFight_, which explores interdimensional traversal, and _Outer Pixels_, where transformation and modular identity take center stage.
