### App Improvements
- [ ]  Faster camera or faster implementation of OpenCamera. Find ways to optimize it. Fully supplant OG camera app with this once it's faster.
- [ ] Find a way to consolidate Wee Notes with Notion. Perhaps WeeNotes is actually the better option if I use my own backup.
- [ ] Create a cleanup list here of uninstalled and apps to uninstall:

### Control Phone With PC


### Clone Phone to VM


### Rearrange Home Screen


### Automation Processes
**Current State:**
- Disorganized MacroDroid implementations to get around free and limitations of said platform

**Goal:**
- Transfer current automations to Tasker for greater flexibility
- Start using direct scripting API to create automations, testing within VM of my machine and then deploying

**Automations:**
- Caretaking automation -- regular reminder, check-in button, progressively insistent
- Obsidian -- push and pull logic like I use in my PC and Mac
- Flashlight gesture -- direct access to accelerometer through Tasker should allow me to simulate moto gestures
- Open camera (opens a dialogue to take an instant picture with no sound)
- WeeNote Github Backup automation - nightly. This one should be pretty straightforward tbh.

**Buttons:**
- Button to trigger Weenote backup manually
- Caretaking Button
- Obsidian Push/Pull button option
