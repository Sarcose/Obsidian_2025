#### Brief
A single "source of truth" calendar that merges all my calendars and lets me integrate planting plans into it.


#### Current Calendars
Current calendars I use and their notes:
- Google Calendar:
	- Has all Wesley weekend data, people's birthdays etc.
	- Drawbacks: it kinda sucks? I don't love it. Also it has a lot of extraneous data. I don't like the filter options
	- I have a shitload of unorganized Google Accounts
- Microsoft Calendar:
	- My work calendar

#### A Third Calendar
- What I would like is a third Calendar app that is **distinct and separate** from Google and Microsoft so that I can isolate it into projects and look at that exclusively, then swap between Google (Life), Microsoft (Family), Projects (Personal)

#### Goals
**Merging these two calendars** alongside a **Secondary or Tertiary App** that lets me manage these in a view format which would allow me to:
- Switch between official calendars (Google, Microsoft, Planting, Project?)
- View all events in a single view (work | school | wesley | planting | projects)
- Filter types
- Possibly something that I can view on the internet


#### Options
##### Google Calendar
- It may be possible to use it in this way, and I'm just not using it right
- Maybe a new Google Account, or focus a less used Google Account
- Maybe just a Google Calendar wrapper
- Google Calendars are probably most compatible with internet
- Maybe jsut use google calendar cuz i'm very versed with it siiiiiigh

##### aCalendar
- Google Play App
- Probably won't be able to view on macos, idk
