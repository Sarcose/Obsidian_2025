This document will serve as a repository of news sources and I will attempt to begin developing a healthy way to engage and keep myself informed.


### Categories
- **Anticapitalist**
	- Org newsletters
	- Nation News - news from other nations that skew left, their party propaganda as well as independent sources if they exist
	- "Leftism" - news sources that skew left and don't pull punches but represent a variety of viewpoints within that sphere
	- "Leftism Lite" - news sources that border on liberal, offering potentially "gateway analyses" for non-leftists or those on "the left" but with gaps in their understanding
	- Activist Groups and discussions
		- Mutual aid orgs
		- Orgs that may skew any political leaning but work with their community (local only)
	- Interest groups and discussions -- Reddit forums, Discord groups, etc.. Interest groups I am looking for:
		- Tech news
		- Video game news
		- Game development
		- Demoscene
		- Gardening
- **NonWhite and Diverse Groups Focused on Actions** - distinct from Anticapitalist because the ideological leaning of a marginalized demographic need not be directly anticapitalist for revolutionary actions to be compatible
- **Liberal** - for keeping informed on Liberal viewpoints.
	- MSM sources - maybe an aggregator would be best here.
	- "Independent" sources that skew liberal - e.g., DailyKos.
	- At least one or two active communities discussing "rEsIsTaNcE". Local is preferred. Understanding how the community is communicating about events is key.
- **Conservative** aka Liberal to Neoliberal to outright Fascist
	- MSM - like for Liberal, I think an aggregator would be best
	- "Independent" (lol) sources
	- People who aggregate and report on what alt right characters are doign
	- The Bad Places like 8Chan
- **International** aka other country news sources that may not be anticapitalist. Hearing what many international news orgs are saying is important as well.
