# Antifash
- Razor
- Tire stem solution -- spikes instead of snips? They seem to be primarily made of metal.
- Glue to cover fingerprints - test with fingerprint scanners.
- Needle Nose Pliers

- Small can of black spraypaint or something that would be easily applied like this.

- For the sake of anonymization I will need a way to hide my beard:
# Beard
- Shave off parts that would be too hard to obscure

- Use got2b or another glue or shaping option to hold it in place.

# Hair
- Hair is a problem, it's too obvious.
- Learn to use baldcaps.
- Get wigs and learn to apply them



# Car
- Alcohol to remove glue from beard

- Extra supplies
