Garden tasks

- Garden needs for bonus (today)

- Raise lamps again (tonight)

- Redo unsuccessful seed pots (this week)

- Finish making extra planters (this week)

- Do transplants to planters: romas, beefsteaks

- Use transplanted-from tray to transplant others or seed others (more bunching onion?)

Systems and algorithms

- Logging system for medical expenditures (to predict what I can add to my HSA in 2026)

**Adding more:**

- See if HabitNow has an API I can query and manipulate, to send my mother's emails to

- Otherwise -- once a week, check mother's emails

- A sticky note specifically for mother, kept on my notes homepage

- Find a "floating calendar" app instead of using that widget

  

  

**Note:**

Continue keeping one or two tasks in Rem in order to keep up with updates and see how well it works. I do still like this app. It'd be real nice if it could work with an API

  

  

**Some Garden Desires:**

- Moisture sensor

- Another lamp shade

  

  

**Illinois Taxes:**
