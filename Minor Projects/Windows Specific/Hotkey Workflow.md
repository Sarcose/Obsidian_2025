### Brief

Absent KBM I don't have a good hotkey setup for my Windows machine. However, I'm getting there. For the most part, there are three avenues to be concerned with:
- Replicating Obsidian hotkeys
- Identifying where I can use hotkeys to improve my Windows workflow
- Identifying if any hotkeys I use in macOS need equivalents in Windows
