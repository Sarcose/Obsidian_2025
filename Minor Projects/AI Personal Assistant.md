### Premise
- An "Agent" that has access to LLM input and data inference to take control of tasks on my Windows machine, eventually behaving with a "personality" which will help it develop more and more efficiency flows.

### Build my Own?
- Set up LLM backbone
	- From DeepSeek: `Use OpenAI's GPT-4 API or a local LLM (e.g., Llama 2, Mistral) for natural language understanding. Example: Send user commands to the LLM and parse the response to extract intent.`
- Build Task Execution Modules
	- From DeepSeek:
		- Write Python Scripts to perform specific tasks on your computer
		- Example: Create a reminder using Windows Task Scheduler
	- ðŸ’¡This is a good idea to start with but over time I want it to have total control of my computer possibly
- Add memory and learning
	- Store user preferences and task history in a database or file
	- Example: use SQLite to store reminders and preferences
- Enable proactive Behavior
	- Analyze stored data to infer patterns and suggest actions
	- Example: create "suggest" functions that it can use specifically
	- ðŸ’¡Explanation: My first step with creating inference is to know what I am wanting it to infer. Establish inference patterns and develop the actual scripts for those myself. 
		- Eventually, it can begin to develop its own unique inferences?
- Add personality and interaction
	- Use the LLM to simulate a conversational personality
- Tools and Technologies:
	- Python
	- LLM: Deepseek
	- Task Execution: python libs like `subprocess` `os` or `pywin32`
	- Database: SQLite, Json
	- Frontend: a simple CLI or GUI (e.g., Tkinter, Streamlit)

### External Agents to Start With
#### Frameworks
- AutoGPT
- BabyAGI
- LangChain
- Microsoft Jarvis (HuggingGPT)
- GPT Engineer
Certainly! Below is a **comparison table** of the different frameworks and tools for building or using AI agents, based on common differentiators like **ease of use**, **customization**, **features**, and **limitations**:

##### **Key Differentiators Explained**

1. **Ease of Use**:
    
    - **Easy**: Ready-to-use solutions like Reclaim AI and Motion require minimal setup.
        
    - **Moderate**: Tools like AutoGPT and BabyAGI require some technical knowledge but are well-documented.
        
    - **Advanced**: Frameworks like LangChain and Microsoft Jarvis require programming expertise.
        
2. **Customization**:
    
    - **High**: AutoGPT, BabyAGI, and LangChain allow extensive customization for specific use cases.
        
    - **Low**: Reclaim AI and Motion are more rigid and focused on specific tasks.
        
3. **Key Features**:
    
    - **Autonomy**: AutoGPT and BabyAGI excel at autonomous task execution.
        
    - **Integration**: LangChain and Microsoft Jarvis support integration with APIs, databases, and external tools.
        
    - **Task-Specific**: Reclaim AI and Motion are optimized for scheduling and task management.
        
4. **Limitations**:
    
    - **Technical**: Many frameworks require programming knowledge and setup.
        
    - **Scope**: Some tools (e.g., Reclaim AI, Motion) are limited to specific tasks.
        
    - **Early-Stage**: Microsoft Jarvis and Adept are still in development and may lack stability.
